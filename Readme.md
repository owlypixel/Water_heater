## What is this?
On this project I was practicing using GreenSock animation library to change element properties on the page. 
You can play around and experiment with it [here](http://codepen.io/owlypixel/pen/QGPNBN) on CodePen. 
## What you'll learn from this
### GreenSock
- Using Draggable library to make elements spin
- Imposing bounds on an element's rotation
- Using onUpdate function to perform some actions when you spin an element

### CSS
- Using cool generated [repeatable SVG backgrounds](http://www.heropatterns.com) for the body of the page
- How to create fire simulation in pure CSS
- How to use linear gradients to achieve metallic surface effect
- Using SASS mixin to generate styles for elements that are distributed regularly over the circle
